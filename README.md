Hello,

I currently live in Colorado. However, I was raised in a small town in Southern Illinois with only 900 people. We only had a hardware store, gas station, 2 bars, and 2 hair salons. Needless to say, I was bored. After a rocky relationship, I moved to colorful Colorado to live with my dad and sister. I could not think of a better change in my life. I have been living here for the past 2 1/2 years. When I moved to Colorado I decided I wanted to make a better life for myself and not depend on anyone. However, I wanted to still enjoy what I did. This has led me to different avenues such as doggie day care, dental assisting, and currently accounting. I was introduced to web development/web design back in high school where I absolutely loved the class but was too focused on a different career path I didn't see what was right in front of me. I have recently rediscovered my interest after feeling disillusioned in the accounting field. Therefore, I have decided to immerse myself back into the web development/design world to test the waters and hopefully make a career out of it. I feel confident in finding a community that is supportive and growing. If anyone reads this, thank you for reading my rambling.
